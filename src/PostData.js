        body: "As you read this blog and take action on what we talk about, there is a transformation that will happen for you. You will rest easier, become more relaxed, and find joy in using the internet that is at yourfinger tips. Of course, there are a lot of other things that could be creating anxiety for you, but we hope it is not the fear of being hacked.\n I have experienced that fearful feeling of wondering if my internet was hacked and what it will cost to fix it. See the post Why I Care About Computer Security for the back story. Since taking personal control over my home internet and using the tools I share in this blog, I have not worried about being hacked."

        body: "UPDATING: One of the first things you can do is to always keep your operating system  and software up to date.\n PASSWORDS: Good passwords are a must. Do you have one quick password to use on all your logins? If someone discovers it, they will have access to all your data. It is best practice to use a different password for each login and it must be a long one(8 to 16 characters). Hint: use a Password Manager. More on that in future posts."
